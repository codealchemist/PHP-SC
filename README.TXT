PHP Shell Commander (PHP-SC)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL
The main purpose of this project is to manage Linux shells using a web interface
and with the posibility to control multiple shells at once, sending the same
commands to all of them; this is very useful to handle replicated servers.

DESCRIPTION
Allows to configure multiple ssh logins and to group them to send the same
commands to all of them.
The app provides independent output for each shell and an easy way to switch
between independent ones, add more shells and create groups of them.
